 <h3> Logistic regression , unlike linear regression which fits a straight line through a set of points, fits an s-shaped curve through a set of points.</h3>
 <h3> It is typically used when then outcome variable is binary.  For example here the outcome is either died or survived.</h3>
 <h3>  The s shaped fits to the points much better and the output is bounded between 0-1, e.g. the range in which probabilities can exist.</h3>
